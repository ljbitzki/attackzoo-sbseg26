# AttackZoo: A Reproducible Testbed for Attack Execution and Network Traffic Datasets Generation

This repository contains **AttackZoo**, a Docker-based testbed for building and running controlled network, application, and IoT attack scenarios. The artifact automates target servers, benign clients, attack containers, traffic capture, feature extraction, dataset generation, and experiment reporting through both a command-line (CLI) interface and an optional Streamlit Web UI.

The associated paper, `"AttackZoo: A Reproducible Testbed for Attack Execution and Network Traffic Datasets Generation"` presents an environment for producing reproducible traffic evidence from parameterized Docker attacks. The artifact is intended to let reviewers inspect the testbed, run attacks in an isolated lab, capture PCAP files, extract traffic features, generate datasets, telemetry metrics, reports, charts and experimental campaigns metadata.

**Paper abstract**: _The recurring generation of network traffic datasets for cybersecurity research is constrained by fragmented experimental workflows, limited reproducibility, and restricted coverage of attack vectors. This paper presents AttackZoo, a reproducible testbed that integrates a containerized repository of 60 attacks categorized according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and a CLI-centered orchestration layer, complemented by an optional Streamlit UI, that automates the full cycle of execution, data collection, and consolidation. The pipeline incorporates traffic capture, log inspection, and feature extraction using multiple tools, producing structured and traceable datasets. By providing broad coverage of attacks, techniques, and tactics among existing testbeds, AttackZoo reduces the operational overhead of experiments and enables the systematic generation of comparable datasets, with all artifacts openly available._

## Dependencies

### System Dependencies

`setup.sh` installs and/or configures the main dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian-like systems:

- `ca-certificates`
- `curl`
- `git`
- `python3-venv`
- `tcpdump`
- `tshark`
- Docker Engine 27.0 or newer (`docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, `docker-buildx-plugin`)

Tested package versions on Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS:

| Package | Tested version |
| --- | --- |
| `ca-certificates` | `20260601~24.04.1` |
| `curl` | `8.5.0-2ubuntu10.11` |
| `git` | `1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.3` |

| `containerd.io` | `2.2.6-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble` |
| `docker-buildx-plugin` | `0.35.0-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble` |

>[!CAUTION]
>Please note that **this repository depends** on `Docker Engine` being installed as described in the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and also on the [post-installation instructions for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall). Be advised that installation via `apt install` **might not be compatible**.

The script also adds the current user to the `docker` group, configures capture permissions for `tcpdump`, creates `.venv/`, installs Python dependencies, and installs NTLFlowLyzer Project directly from its GitHub repository at commit `86d0102466ea42ba03ddda5c649ac7e533fb25d9` by default.

### Python Dependencies

`requirements.txt` is frozen with exact versions from the validated `.venv`.
Primary runtime dependencies include:

```text
streamlit==1.58.0
pandas==3.0.4
numpy==2.5.0
matplotlib==3.11.0
scapy==2.7.0
PyYAML==6.0.3
```

The validated `.venv` also contains `NTLFlowLyzer==0.1.0`; `setup.sh` installs it separately from the upstream GitHub repository listed below.

### External Resources Used During Installation

- The official Docker repository for Ubuntu.
- Operating-system package indexes.
- PyPI for Python packages.
- `https://github.com/ahlashkari/NTLFlowLyzer.git` at commit `86d0102466ea42ba03ddda5c649ac7e533fb25d9`.
- Base images and packages referenced by Dockerfiles under `docker/`.
- Dozzle (`docker.io/amir20/dozzle`, pinned by digest) for the optional full-profile container log viewer.

No SSH keys, private credentials, API tokens, or cloud infrastructure are required to run the artifact.

>[!NOTE]
> The time required to complete the process may vary depending on the host's resources and the available internet speed.

## Safety Considerations

This artifact runs scanners, brute-force tools, fuzzers, floods, and other attack behaviors. **Use it only in an environment that you own, isolate, and are authorized to test.**

Safe review recommendations:

- Run the artifact on an isolated dedicated machine or disposable lab environment.
- Avoid installing the testbed on a workstation or shared host.
- Do not point attacks at external addresses, third-party networks, or services without explicit authorization.
- Prefer internal testbed targets, such as the `server-*` containers.
- Avoid exposing the host directly to the Internet during review.
- Check for port conflicts before starting servers.
- Use short durations for DoS/flood attacks during initial tests.
- Stop attack containers after validation with `python3 attackzoo.py stop <attack_id>` or `docker rm -f <container>`.
- The full image build starts Dozzle on host port `11080` and mounts `/var/run/docker.sock`. Access to that port should be treated as Docker host control; keep it inside the isolated lab and remove it with `docker rm -f suporte-dozzle` if it is not needed.

Ports that may be exposed on the host:
**TCP**: 139, 445, 1883, 2222, 2323, 5683, 7447, 8080, 8443, 9001, 11080.
**UDP**: 137, 138, 5683, 8888.

>[!NOTE]
> Weak passwords and intentionally vulnerable configurations in the containers are disposable lab values. Do not reuse them anywhere else.

## Installation process

### Demonstration video of the installation process

[![installation-process-video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fx2Z5ZD_Rbo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx2Z5ZD_Rbo)

>[!TIP]
>This video demonstrates and follows all the steps listed below.

The steps below assume a **clean Ubuntu 24.04 LTS machine** or an equivalent environment.

### 1. Clone the repository and enters it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GT-IoTEdu/attackzoo-sbseg26.git
cd attackzoo-sbseg26
```

### 2. Install system and Python dependencies with an _`one-script-setup`_

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh dependencies
```

After installation, apply the new Docker group permission:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

>[!NOTE]
> This command will reload the shell session. It's mandatory to reload the current shell before continue.

_Logging out and back in also applies the group change._

### 3. Build the Docker Images Catalog and Start Servers

Here we have 2 options:
- A `Full Version`: (60 attackers, 9 servers, 2 client types and all dependencies); or
- A `Reduced Version`: (7 attackers, 3 servers and dependencies).

#### \*\* Full Version Installation \*\*

>[!CAUTION]
> This builds all server, attacker, and client images, starts target servers, and other elements. The first build depends on machine and network speed: on a machine similar to the one previously described as the test environment used by the authors, **reserve 15 to 30 minutes** because many Docker images and packages will be downloaded and compiled.

```bash
./setup.sh full
```

#### \*\* Reduced Version Installation \*\* 

>[!TIP]
>For a faster reviewer demonstration, the repository provides this reduced profile with seven attacks, one from each catalog category, and only the HTTP, SSH, and MQTT target servers: yet they still manage to demonstrate all of the tool's capabilities. Even so, the installation typically takes **at least 2 to 5 minutes**. 

```bash
./setup.sh redux
```

The reduced testbed profile does not build benign client images. See [contrib/docs/REDUX_LAB.md](contrib/docs/REDUX_LAB.md) for more information about the included attack list, server profile, and campaign defaults.

### 4. Activate The Python Environment

```bash
cd /path/to/attackzoo-sbseg26
if [[ -z "${VIRTUAL_ENV}" ]]; then
  source .venv/bin/activate
fi
```

### 5. Simples Installation Check

```bash
python3 attackzoo.py status
```

Expected output: `docker_available=true`

>[!NOTE]
>If Docker is not accessible, check whether the service is running and whether Docker group permissions have been applied. See [Troubleshooting](contrib/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common checks.

## Minimal Test

This section runs a short validation to confirm that the CLI loads the catalog, that target servers are active, and a simple attack can be launched against a testbed server.

### 1. Prepare The Session

```bash
cd /path/to/attackzoo-sbseg26
if [[ -z "${VIRTUAL_ENV}" ]]; then
  source .venv/bin/activate
fi
```

### 2. Confirm Docker And The Catalog

```bash
python3 attackzoo.py status
python3 attackzoo.py list --category "Denial"
```

Expected results:

- `docker_available=true`.
- A list of attacks from `6) Denial of Service and Impact`, including `dos_http_simple`.

### 3. Confirm That The HTTP Server Is Active

```bash
./servers.sh start
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep server-http-server
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you installed the reduced version, pass `redux` as the second argument to `servers.sh`:
> `./servers.sh start redux`


Expected result:

- The `server-http-server` container is `Up`.
- The HTTP server responds through host port `8080`.

### 4. Run A Short HTTP Attack

Use the internal IP of the HTTP container and its internal port `80`:

```bash
HTTP_IP=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' server-http-server)
python3 attackzoo.py run dos_http_simple --target "$HTTP_IP" --port 80
```

Expected result:

```text
[OK] Container started: <container_id>
```

`dos_http_simple` is a one-shot attack: it sends a short burst of HTTP requests and exits on its own. To inspect active or previous attack containers:

```bash
python3 attackzoo.py ps
python3 attackzoo.py ps --all
```

### 5. Run A Short Baseline Experiment

This command validates the `experiment` workflow without launching a real attack by using only level `L0`:

```bash
python3 attackzoo.py experiment \
  --attack-id dos_http_simple \
  --out smoke_http \
  --runs 1 \
  --levels L0 \
  --warmup 3 \
  --attack 3 \
  --cooldown 3 \
  --probes http \
  --http-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \
  --iface lo \
  --bpf "tcp port 8080"
```

Expected outputs:

- `experiments/smoke_http/dos_http_simple/L0/run01/`.
- `probe_http.csv` with HTTP probe data.
- A `.pcap` file if `tcpdump` is installed and authorized.
- `experiments/smoke_http/reports/` with tables and charts when enough data is available.

Accepted availability probes for `--probes` are `http`, `https`, `ssh`, `smb`, `mqtt`, `coap`, `xrce`, `zenoh`, and `telnet`. Use `all` to enable all probes or `none` to disable them. For service-specific endpoints, repeat `--probe-endpoint`, for example `--probe-endpoint ssh=172.17.0.3:22`.

## Reproducible Experiment Claims

The claims below are automated reviewer checks. Run each command from the repository root after completing the installation and image build. Each script activates `.venv` automatically when it is available and prints a final comparison block.

For reduced installations, Claims 2 and 3 use the HTTP subset and can be run with the default `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=redux`. For a full installation, prefix the command with `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=full`, for example `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=full bash run_claim2.sh`.

Live traffic contains scheduler, Docker startup, TCP timing, and target-response variance; the reproducibility target is therefore the generated evidence shape and aggregate paper metrics, not byte-identical packet timing. See [Reproducibility notes](contrib/docs/REPRODUCIBILITY_NOTES.md) for the variance discussion, dataset audit trail, and dependency provenance.

### Claim 1: The Artifact Provides An Extensible Catalog Of Containerized Attacks

Goal: show that the CLI automatically discovers attacks declared in `docker/attackers/*/attack.yaml`, groups them by category, and exposes the expected JSON fields.

Configuration files to edit: none.

Command:

```bash
bash run_claim1.sh
```

Flags used:

- `attackzoo.py list --json` inside the script.

Expected time: less than 1 minute.

Expected resources: one Python process; less than 512 MB RAM; no Docker containers or new datasets.

Expected result:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Claim 1 — Attack catalog
Attacks in catalog  : 60
Categories          : 7
JSON fields         : yes
Expected result     : 60 attacks / 7 categories / JSON fields → OK
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Claim 2: The Environment Runs Attacks Against Containerized Target Servers

Goal: demonstrate functional attack execution against a Dockerized HTTP target inside the testbed.

Configuration files to edit: none.

Command:

```bash
bash run_claim2.sh
```

Flags used:

- Optional environment flag: `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=redux` by default, or `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=full`.
- `attackzoo.py run dos_http_simple --target <server-ip> --port 80 --duration 3 --count 500 --concurrency 4 --delay_ms 50`.

Expected time: 1 to 5 minutes after images have already been built.

Expected resources: Docker daemon access, the HTTP server image and `dos_http_simple` attack image already built, host port `8080`, and less than 2 GB RAM during the short run.

Expected result:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Claim 2 — Execution against a Docker server
Docker available    : yes
HTTP server         : Up
Attack started      : yes
Attack stopped      : yes
Stop confirmation   : [OK] Stopped: attack-dos-http-simple
Expected result     : Docker + active HTTP server + executed attack → OK
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Claim 3: The Artifact Generates Traffic Evidence, Features, Datasets, Reports, And Paper Figures

Goal: demonstrate both a reduced end-to-end experiment and a complete paper-figure regeneration path from the published Figshare campaign dataset.

Configuration files to edit: none.

Reduced command for the minimum reviewer check:

```bash
bash run_claim3.sh
```

Preparation is handled by the script: it starts the HTTP server with `./servers.sh start "$ATTACKZOO_PROFILE"` and waits until `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` is reachable before running the experiment. The default profile is `redux`; use `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=full bash run_claim3.sh` for a full installation.

Flags used:

- Optional environment flag: `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=redux` by default, or `ATTACKZOO_PROFILE=full`.
- `attackzoo.py experiment --attack-id dos_http_simple --out claim3_http --service claim3_http --runs 1 --levels L0,L1 --warmup 2 --attack 3 --cooldown 2 --interval 0.5 --probe-timeout 1 --probes http --http-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/ --host <server-ip> --port 80 --iface lo --bpf "tcp port 8080" --extract-features --build-dataset --tools-scapy`.
- Hook flags: `--attack-start-hook "python3 attackzoo.py run dos_http_simple ..."` and `--attack-stop-hook "python3 attackzoo.py stop dos_http_simple"`.

Expected time: less than 2 minutes after images have already been built.

Expected resources: Docker daemon access, `tcpdump`, host port `8080`, loopback capture permission, less than 2 GB RAM, and less than 1 GB additional disk for the reduced evidence, features, datasets, and reports.

Expected result:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Claim 3 — Evidence, features, and datasets
Completed runs      : 2
Valid PCAPs         : 2
Features Scapy      : 2
Datasets            : 2
Reports             : yes
Expected result     : 2 runs / PCAPs / features / datasets / reports → OK
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Complete paper-figure regeneration:

```bash
ATTACKZOO_CONFIRM_LARGE_DOWNLOAD=1 bash run_claim_figures.sh
```

Flags used:

- Required environment flag for the large download: `ATTACKZOO_CONFIRM_LARGE_DOWNLOAD=1`.
- Optional environment flags: `FIGSHARE_ARTICLE_ID`, `FIGSHARE_DOI`, `ATTACKZOO_FIGSHARE_DIR`, `ATTACKZOO_FIGURES_REPORT`, and `ATTACKZOO_FIGSHARE_MIN_FREE_GB`.
- `campaign_traffic_stats.py --campaign-dir <extracted-campaign> --reports-root contrib/reports --campaign-name paper_figures --source auto --plots all --progress-interval 25`.

This complete mode resolves the Figshare DOI `10.6084/m9.figshare.32900828`, downloads `attackzoo-full_campaign_5runs_4levels.tar.gz` from the public Figshare API when needed, verifies the MD5 checksum, unpacks the campaign, and runs `contrib/scripts/campaign_traffic_stats.py --plots all`.

Audit target: the script fails unless the extracted published dataset contains `60` attack directories and the regenerated manifest reports `1200/1200` PCAPs and `8` figure outputs.

>[!CAUTION]
>The complete mode downloads a **16.9 GB** compressed archive and needs at least **225 GB** of additional space to unpack the campaign. The script requires **260 GiB** free by default, which can be adjusted with `ATTACKZOO_FIGSHARE_MIN_FREE_GB`. Regeneration can take roughly **30 to 60 minutes**, depending on disk and CPU speed.

Expected resources: `curl`, `tar`, `md5sum`, the Python environment, at least `260 GiB` free in `ATTACKZOO_FIGSHARE_DIR`, and enough CPU/disk bandwidth for a 30 to 60 minute aggregation pass.

Expected complete result:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Claim 3 — Full paper figure reproduction
DOI Figshare        : 10.6084/m9.figshare.32900828
Compressed archive  : attackzoo-full_campaign_5runs_4levels.tar.gz
Attacks             : 60
PCAPs processed     : 1200/1200
Traffic counted     : <reported GiB>
Figures generated   : 8
Report              : contrib/reports/paper_figures
Expected result     : 60 attacks / 1200 PCAPs / 8 figures / manifest OK → OK
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
