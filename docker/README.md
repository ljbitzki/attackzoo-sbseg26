# Docker Containers

This directory contains the Docker assets used by AttackZoo to build target servers, benign clients, and attack containers for controlled experiments.

## Directory Layout

- `attackers/`: attack container definitions. Each subdirectory includes an `attack.yaml`, a `README.md`, and the container implementation files.
- `servers/`: target server definitions. Each subdirectory includes a `server.yaml`, a `README.md`, and the files needed to build or run the service.
- `clients/`: benign client definitions. Each subdirectory includes a `client.yaml`, a `README.md`, and the traffic generator implementation.

## Build All Images

From this `docker/` directory:

```bash
chmod +x build-images.sh
./build-images.sh
```

The script builds all server, attacker, and client images. It also starts the standard target servers and a Dozzle container for log monitoring.

## Target Servers

| Directory | ID | Image | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`servers/coap-server/`](servers/coap-server/) | `coap-server` | `server-coap-server:latest` | Serve as a target for CoAP GET requests, resource discovery, fuzzing, and token collisions. |
| [`servers/http-server/`](servers/http-server/) | `http-server` | `server-http-server:latest` | Provide a vulnerable web application for web attacks, scanners, enumeration, and controlled HTTP DoS. |
| [`servers/mqtt-broker/`](servers/mqtt-broker/) | `mqtt-broker` | `server-mqtt-broker:latest` | Act as an MQTT broker for publishing, brute force, LWT abuse, and QoS amplification in IoT experiments. |
| [`servers/smb-server/`](servers/smb-server/) | `smb-server` | `server-smb-server:latest` | Provide an SMB/Samba share for enumeration and benign share-listing traffic. |
| [`servers/ssh-server/`](servers/ssh-server/) | `ssh-server` | `server-ssh-server:latest` | Serve as a target for SSH brute force and ICMP/SSH tunneling in controlled experiments. |
| [`servers/ssl-heartbleed/`](servers/ssl-heartbleed/) | `ssl-heartbleed` | `server-ssl-heartbleed:latest` | Provide a vulnerable HTTPS target for Heartbleed attack validation and observable TLS traffic generation. |
| [`servers/telnet-server/`](servers/telnet-server/) | `telnet-server` | `server-telnet-server:latest` | Serve as a target for Telnet brute force and simple benign login traffic. |
| [`servers/xrce-dds-agent/`](servers/xrce-dds-agent/) | `xrce-dds-agent` | `server-xrce-dds-agent:latest` | Serve as an XRCE-DDS agent for IoT attacks involving discovery, entities, fragments, sessions, timing, and UDP DoS. |
| [`servers/zenoh-router/`](servers/zenoh-router/) | `zenoh-router` | `server-zenoh-router:latest` | Serve as a Zenoh router for Zenoh-Pico attacks against fragmentation, keepalive, memory, fuzzing, sequence, and timestamp behavior. |

## Benign Clients

| Directory | ID | Image | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`clients/client-random/`](clients/client-random/) | `client-random` | `client-random:latest` | Generate continuous benign noise during experiments by randomly choosing among supported protocol clients. |
| [`clients/client-super/`](clients/client-super/) | `client-super` | `client-super:latest` | Generate controlled benign traffic with count, interval, and duration defined by parameters. |

From the repository root, use `clients.sh` to control client containers:

```bash
./clients.sh start all
./clients.sh restart random
./clients.sh stop super
CLIENT_SUPER_SERVICE=coap ./clients.sh start super
```

## Running Individual Attacks

Prefer the project CLI when possible because it keeps the run tied to the declarative catalog:

```bash
python3 attackzoo.py run <ATTACK_ID> --target <TARGET>
```

Each attacker subdirectory README also includes a direct `docker run` example for isolated validation.

## Inspecting Target Servers

Use Docker directly to inspect target server IP addresses and logs:

```bash
docker container inspect server-http-server --format '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}'
docker logs server-mqtt-broker
```

For controlled experiments, prefer:

```bash
python3 attackzoo.py experiment
```

Expected artifacts include PCAP files, probe CSVs, optional telemetry, generated features, datasets, and reports under `experiments/`.

## Cleanup

Containers created by this directory use the catalog names declared in the YAML files, such as `server-*`, `attack-*`, and `client-*`.

```bash
docker ps -a --format "{{.Names}}" | grep -E '^(server|attack|client)-' | xargs -r docker rm -f
```
