# STP TCN Flood (`net_stp_tcn_flood`)

[Campaign index](README.md)

This document summarizes the published campaign execution of attack `net_stp_tcn_flood`. In the local catalog, the attack is described as: BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) packet flood with STP topology change information and random MAC addresses. The full execution artifacts are not versioned in this repository; retrieve the generated dataset CSVs from the Figshare dataset linked in the campaign index. Raw PCAP captures are not included in that archive. The selected figures below are stored under `contrib/assets/campaign_doc`.
